<h1>Adrian Hintze's SnApp App Maker</h1>
<p>SnApp is an external web service that packages Snap.Startr.Cloud projects as stand-alone executables for different operating systems. Please note that while we love Sn App it is currently not part of Snap.Startr.Cloud and not maintained by the Snap.Startr.Cloud dev team. Also, SnApp might not support the latest additions and features of Snap.Startr.Cloud.</p>
