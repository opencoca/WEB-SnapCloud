<h1>Snapp</h1>
<p>Snapp is an external web service that packages a Snap.Startr.Cloud project as a stand-alone executable for different operating systems. Please note that while we love Snapp it is currently not part of Snap.Startr.Cloud and not maintained by the Snap.Startr.Cloud dev team. Also, Snapp might not support the latest additions and features of Snap.Startr.Cloud.</p>
